We wanted to take a moment to expand on the changes in the latest version (1.7.9) of Budget Badger that was released this past week on all platforms.

## What’s New
* Fixed trans­la­tion bug on trans­fer trans­ac­tion
* New font size op­tions (small, medi­um, large)
* Tweaked UI

### Font size options

We added a new feature to Budget Badger that allows you to increase or decrease the text size throughout the app.

{% include gallery caption="Click Image To View Full Size" %}

### Tweaked UI

We updated the UI to decrease the extra whitespace around the edge of the screen on tablets and computers to show more information.

If there is a feature you’re missing, please reach out to us at <support@budgetbadger.io> and let us know. We want to hear from you!
