Budget Badger has come a long way from just an idea scribbled on some scrap paper to having an app available on all the major app stores and thousands of users. So first, we want to say thank you to each of our users for making that happen! We couldn’t have done it without you. We wanted to take a few minutes to lay out our future plans and a roadmap for where Budget Badger is planning to grow from here.
