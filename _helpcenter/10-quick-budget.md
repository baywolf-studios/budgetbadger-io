Quick Budget gives you different options to make your budgeting easier, while leaving you in charge.

## How do I Quick Budget?

- Quick Budget allows you to see information about that envelope’s activity. When budgeting, it can be helpful to see the previous months budgeted amount or what was spent on average in that envelope. These intuitive options make setting up your budget quick and simple.
- To use the quick budget feature, edit the envelope for the month you are budgeting. You can do this two different ways. The first way is to click on the envelope and in the upper right hand corner, click the edit icon. The second way is when you are on the envelopes page, swipe your finger from right to left over the envelope you want to edit. This will bring up the option to edit or transfer.


## What are the various Quick Budget options?

### Last Month Activity

This is the total activity for the last month. This total includes outflows and inflows for this envelope.

### Last Month Budgeted

This is the dollar amount you budgeted last month in this envelope.

### Past 3 Months Activity

This is the total average activity for the last three months. This total includes outflows and inflows for this envelope.

### Past 3 Months Budgeted

This is the average dollar amount you budgeted for the previous three months.

### Past Year Activity

This is the average activity for the last year for this envelope. This total includes inflows and outflows for this envelope.

### Past Year Budgeted

This is the average dollar amount you budgeted for the previous year in this envelope. 

### Balance

This will make the balance of the envelope $0. It will add either a positive or a negative amount in the budget field to make the balance $0.

## Why don't all of the options show up for an Envelope?

If there has not been any activity in the envelope, you will not see the Last Month Activity, Past 3 Months Activity, or Past Year Activity. If you have never budgeted to this envelope (or haven’t recently) you will not see the Last Month Budgeted, Past 3 Months Budgeted, or Past Year Budgeted. These intuitive Quick Budget options will only appear when applicable.
