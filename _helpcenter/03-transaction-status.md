## What do all of the different statuses of transactions mean?

### Pending

Pending means that the transaction has not cleared through your credit card or bank account. You may use this status to indicate that the transaction has occurred but it has not yet cleared your bank account or credit card.

### Cleared

Cleared means that the transaction has cleared your credit card or bank account and the funds have been taken out of your account or from your credit card balance. 

### Reconciled

Reconciled means that you have received your monthly statement from your bank account or credit card provider and the transaction in Budget Badger matches what is on your statement. Once you proceed with the reconciliation process, the icon will change to a lock and you cannot change the status. However, you will still be able to change the dollar amount, payee, envelope, etc. later if you choose.
